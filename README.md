These Python codes implement Newton's method to find a root of a given function.Numpy library is used, and we keep track of the changes using the Git version control system through GitHub.

The files provided are:
1, newton.py implements the Newton solver with a class Newton
2, testNewton.py tests the Newton solver with unittest
3, functions.py contatins several functions (linear f(x)=Ax+b, 1D polynomial, 2D polynomial) along with their analytical Jacobian, and also a function to approximate the Jacobian matrix
4, testfunctions.py tests functions in functions.py with unittest
5, README is the file you are looking at
